# 💳 CreditX

**CreditX** is a machine learning web app that predicts a user's credit score based on financial data including income, savings, debt, and annual expenditure.

## 🚀 How It Works

- The model is trained on a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/) and split using an 80/20 train-test ratio.
- I used **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** from **Scikit-Learn** to build the predictive model.
- The application is deployed using **Streamlit**.

## 📊 Model Performance

- ✅ **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 26.32  
- ✅ **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 1181.19  
- ✅ **R² Score:** 0.697
