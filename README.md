# CreditX
## Hello and welcome! CreditX is a platform that asks users to input income, savings, debt, and annual expenditure, to predict their credit card score. 
### How It Works: My model is trained on a Kaggle dataset, split into 80 - 20 train/test partitions. I utilized SVMs (Support Vector Machines) from Scikit-Learn to enable predictions, and I deployed the app on Stream lit.

#### The Results: ✅ MAE: 26.32  ✅ MSE: 1181.19 ✅ R² Score: 0.697
